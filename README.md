Peer Review: 
NavBar section- For your navbar you should make the text bigger and the lessen the spacing between the text. Also your navbar doesn't look like it has a responsiveness feature. In bootstrap under the nav components, the first couple navbars include a collapse feature so you could look into that.

First section- There's white spacing between your navbar and image that wasn't in the template. Also your overlay text is not centered with the image, so you could adjust that. For responsiveness, when you shrink the page, the overlay bleeds into other sections, so I think that should be adjusted as well.

2nd section- This section is pretty good, but I would adjust the column size to make the picture next to the text.

Rooms section- For your cards you should add spacing in between the cards and the image widths should fill the whole card. Also your cards, and button radius's should be set to 0 so that it is not rounded. 

Packages section - I think you're missing the packages heading. Also the images and text should both take up half the column. Other than that it's good.

Amenities section - I think the text sizes under the icons are a little too big, and also I think you're missing an image since you have two 24 hour icons.

Reserve section - You are missing the reserve room heading. I think you should create two separate rows, one for the search bars and one for the image.
